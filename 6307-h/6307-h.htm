<h2 align="center">A MAKE-BELIEVE FIGHT</h2>

<p>&#8220;Attention!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the word of command heard in the toy section
of a large department store one night, after all the
customers and clerks had gone home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Attention!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, what is going on?&#8221; asked a Calico
Clown, as he looked around the corner of a pile of
gaily colored building blocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the Sawdust Doll come back to see us?&#8221;
inquired a Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be good news, if it were true,&#8221;
said a Jumping Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; announced a
Monkey on a Stick, as he climbed up to the top of
his perch and looked over the top of a Noah&#8217;s
Ark. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see the Sawdust Doll anywhere,
nor the White Rocking Horse, nor the Lamb on Wheels.
It isn&#8217;t any of our former friends who have
come back to visit us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it, then?&#8221; asked the Calico Clown,
reaching up to get hold of a long string, for he thought
perhaps he could turn somersaults like the Monkey
on a Stick or the Jumping Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Attention, Soldiers!&#8221; suddenly called
again the first voice that had spoken. &#8220;Ready,
now! Attention!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s the Bold Tin Soldier!&#8221;
said the Jack in the Box, who was the Jumping Jack&#8217;s
cousin. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter down there in
your barracks, my Bold Tin Soldier?&#8221; went on
the Box-Jack, as he was sometimes called for short.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want my men to get ready to march,&#8221;
answered the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;We are going
to have a fancy drill to amuse you, my friends. Would
you like to see me march my men around the counter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much, indeed,&#8221; answered the Candy
Rabbit. &#8220;It is night now, and there are no human
eyes to see what we do. So we toys may come to life
and move about and make believe we are real as much
as we please. We haven&#8217;t had very much fun since
the jolly sailor came and carried away the Lamb on
Wheels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has any one heard anything from her since she
left us?&#8221; asked the Calico Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, the Lamb has a lovely home with a
little girl named Mirabell,&#8221; answered the Jack
in the Box. &#8220;And Mirabell has a brother named
Arnold, and those two children live next door to Dorothy,
who has our dear friend the Sawdust Doll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; asked the Jumping Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really and truly,&#8221; added the Box-Jack.
&#8220;And Dorothy&#8217;s brother, whose name is
Dick, owns the White Rocking Horse who used to be here
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that is quite remarkable,&#8221; said
the Monkey on a Stick. &#8220;I hope we all get homes
with such nice children when we are sold and taken
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well say that,&#8221; came from the
Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;Some children are not as
kind to their toys as they might be. But now, if you
want to see me and my men march around in fancy drill,
please take your places and keep out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, we must keep out of the way,&#8221;
said the Candy Rabbit. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
get pricked with a soldier&#8217;s bayonet or tickled
with the Captain&#8217;s sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And be sure to keep well back from the edge
of the counter,&#8221; went on the Bold Tin Soldier.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any of you falling off when
the guns are fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear me! has any one a bit of cotton?&#8221;
asked a Rag Doll, who sat next to a picture book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cotton? Why do you want cotton?&#8221; asked
the Calico Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear what the Bold Tin Soldier
said?&#8221; asked the Rag Doll. &#8220;He spoke about
guns going to be shot off, and I can&#8217;t bear
loud noises. If I can find some cotton I am going to
stuff it into my ears so I won&#8217;t be made deaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Box-Jack and the Jumping Jack stood side by side
as cousins ought; the Candy Rabbit found a place near
the Noah&#8217;s Ark; the Monkey on a Stick found
a place as near the parade grounds as the Bold Captain
would let him come; and the Calico Clown moved over
close to the Rag Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the guns should, by accident, shoot too
loudly,&#8221; said the Clown. &#8220;I will hold
my hands over your ears, Miss Rag Doll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very kind of you,&#8221; she answered
with a smile. &#8220;But please do not bang your cymbals,
as they make almost as much noise as the soldiers&#8217;
guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; promised the
Calico Clown, who wore a gay suit of many colors,
one leg being red and the other yellow, while his shirt
was spotted, speckled and striped. On the end of each
arm was a round disk of brass. These were called &#8220;cymbals,&#8221;
and when any one pressed on the Clown&#8217;s chest
he moved his arms and banged his cymbals together
with a clanging sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Attention!&#8221; called the Bold Tin Soldier
again, and at this word of command the other Tin Soldiers
in the box with their Captain stood up and began to
move into line, each one carrying his gun over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>As I have told you in my other books, the toys could
pretend to come to life and move about after dark,
when no one was in the store to see them. The toys
could also move about by themselves in the day time,
if no human eyes watched them. But as there was nearly
always some one&ndash;either clerk or customer&ndash;in the
store during the day, the toys seldom had a chance
to do as they pleased during daylight hours. So most
of their fun took place after dark, as was happening
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Attention!&#8221; once more called the Captain.
&#8220;Get ready, my brave men! Forward&ndash;March!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then while some of the Soldiers who had fifes,
drums, trumpets and horns played a lively tune, the
others, led by their Captain, marched along. They
went down the toy counter and paraded past the place
where the Candy Rabbit sat watching them. Straight
and stiff marched the Tin Soldiers, the music of the
tin band becoming more and more lively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Left, wheel!&#8221; called the Captain, and
the Tin Soldiers turned to the left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, wheel!&#8221; shouted the Captain, and
the Tin Soldiers turned to the right.</p>

<p>Then they marched around in a circle, and they marched
in a square, and they marched in a triangle, and in
all sorts of fancy figures. They swung around the
Rag Doll, and the Captain waved his shiny sword so
fast that the Calico Clown cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is so dazzling bright that it hurts
my eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the Bold Tin Soldier Captain led his men
up a hill made of a pile of building blocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope they do not fall off!&#8221; said
the Rag Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t fall,&#8221; answered
the Candy Rabbit. &#8220;I guess the Captain knows
what he is doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Straight up the building-block hill the Bold Tin Soldier
led his men, and when they reached the top he cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh mercy me!&#8221; screamed the Rag Doll,
&#8220;they&#8217;ll all be killed!&#8221;</p>

<p>And those Tin Soldiers, who, like other soldiers,
must always obey their officers, jumped right off
the top of the building-block hill.</p>

<p>But they were not killed, nor was one of them hurt,
I am glad to say. For at the bottom of the pile of
blocks was a rubber football, and the Soldiers landed
on this, bounced up and down, and then gently landed
on the counter. The Captain knew the football was
there, or he would not have told his men to jump.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, that was a fine drill!&#8221; said the
Rag Doll. &#8220;How exciting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! They are going to do something else,&#8221;
said the Monkey on a Stick.</p>

<p>And it did seem so, for part of the Soldiers, shouldering
their guns, marched to one end of the toy counter,
and the others, with their Captain at their head,
remained near the pile of blocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; asked the Captain of
a Sergeant who had charge of the second half of the
tin soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready, sir!&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Load! Aim! Fire!&#8221; suddenly cried the
Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they are going to shoot! Oh, it&#8217;s
going to be war! There is going to be a battle!&#8221;
cried the Rag Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! It is only going to be a make-believe
battle!&#8221; said the Calico Clown. &#8220;Our Captain
told me about it. It is to be a sham battle to amuse
us. See, they are aiming their guns at one another!&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he spoke the Rag Doll looked and saw the two
companies of Tin Soldiers ready to take part in a
battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hold me! Hold me!&#8221; whispered the
Rag Doll to the Calico Clown. &#8220;I know I am going
to faint!&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch2"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER II</h1>

<h2 align="center">SAVING THE CLOWN</h2>

<p>&#8220;Ready! Take aim! Fire!&#8221; cried the Bold
Tin Soldier Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bang! Bang!&#8221; cracked the tin guns, some
in the hands of one &#8220;army&#8221; and some shot
off by the other &#8220;army.&#8221; The Soldiers had
divided themselves into two &#8220;armies,&#8221;
to give a make-believe fight to amuse the other toys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crack! Crack! Bang! Bang!&#8221; rattled the
tin guns.</p>

<p>But the guns were so small and there was such a little
bit of the make-believe powder in each one that the
noise they made would not have broken an egg, to say
nothing of hurting the ears of a Rag Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to faint?&#8221; asked the Calico
Clown of the Doll. He stood with his arms stretched
out, ready to catch her in case she did.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No, I don&#8217;t believe I shall faint!&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;Ha! Ha! Ha!&#8221; she suddenly
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is so funny?&#8221; asked the Calico Clown.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell a joke or ask a riddle,
did I?&#8221; For that is what he sometimes did to
make the toys in the department store laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you didn&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; answered
the Rag Doll. &#8220;It is just that you look so funny,
standing there ready to catch me with those brass
things on your hands. Ha! Ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are my cymbals,&#8221; said the Clown.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t let go of them. They are fastened
on. Sometimes I get tired of them, but I cannot get
rid of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, and it was too bad of me to laugh
at you,&#8221; answered the Rag Doll. &#8220;I did
not mean to make fun of you, and it was very kind
on your part, to be ready to catch me if I fainted.
But you did look so funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bold Tin Soldiers were doing their best to make
some entertainment for the other toys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready! Aim! Fire!&#8221; cried the Captain
to his men, again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready! Aim! Fire!&#8221; shouted the Sergeant
to his men, for he had been given command of half
the toy Soldiers for this sham fight.</p>

<p>The guns popped, the Soldiers rushed back and forth
on the toy counter. Some pretended to be hit and fell
down as natural as anything.</p>

<p>But at last the Bold Tin Soldier Captain and his men
seemed to be winning. Most of the Captain&#8217;s
Soldiers were up on their feet, while quite a number
of the Sergeant&#8217;s men had fallen over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surrender! Surrender! Give up!&#8221; shouted
the Captain, as he rushed with his men toward the
Sergeant and his men. &#8220;Surrender! Hoist the
white flag!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, it is hoisted!&#8221; answered the
Sergeant, and he tied his handkerchief on the end
of his gun, where the stickery thing, called a bayonet,
was fastened. &#8220;We surrender!&#8221; said the
Sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! Stop firing!&#8221; called the Captain
to his men. &#8220;We have captured the enemy and
the battle is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad it was only a make-believe
one, and no one was hurt,&#8221; sighed the Rag Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very jolly, all right,&#8221; said the
Candy Rabbit. &#8220;This is the first make-believe
fight I ever saw. Are you going to have another, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;My
men are tired, but we are glad if you toys enjoyed
our efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly did,&#8221; declared the Monkey
on a Stick. &#8220;I wish I had joined the army instead
of going through life on a stick, climbing to the
top and climbing down again,&#8221; he added, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we cannot all be soldiers,&#8221;
said the Jack in the Box.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; agreed the Candy Rabbit.
&#8220;If I had a gun I should not know what to do
with it. It is only brave men, like our Bold Captain
and his men, who know how to use swords and guns,&#8221;
he concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the Captain, waving
his shiny sword. &#8220;We are glad you liked our
drill and make-believe fight. Form in line, ready to
go back to your box, my men,&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>Led by the Sergeant, under whom some of them had fought
in the pretended battle, the Tin Soldiers formed in
line, ready to march back to the box in which they
were kept on the toy counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what will happen to-day,&#8221; remarked
the Calico Clown, as he looked out through a distant
window. &#8220;It will soon be morning,&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;I can see the sun beginning to redden
the sky in the east. I wonder if any of us will be
sold and taken away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might happen,&#8221; said the Bold Tin Soldier.
&#8220;If I have to go I hope my men may come with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course they&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221;
said the Rag Doll. &#8220;Who ever heard of a Soldier
Captain without some men under him? You will all go
together, for you belong in the same box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I hope so,&#8221; went on the
Captain. &#8220;I suppose I shall be bought and given
to some boy. Girls, as a rule, don&#8217;t care very
much for soldiers. They would rather have a Sawdust
Doll or a Lamb on Wheels. And if I am given to some
boy, I hope he will be like the boys we have heard
about&ndash;Dick, the brother of Dorothy, and Arnold, the
brother of Mirabell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are nice boys, from what I have heard,&#8221;
said the Calico Clown. &#8220;Well, it will soon be
bright daylight, and then we shall see what happens,&#8221;
he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said the Captain.
Then, turning to his men, he commanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready&ndash;March.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off to their box marched the Tin Soldiers led by the
Sergeant, who was next in command to the Captain.
There ought to have been a First and Second Lieutenant,
but the man who made the tin toys had forgotten them.</p>

<p>So the Sergeant led the Tin Soldiers back to their
box after the make-believe battle. And, like good
and proper soldiers, they stood themselves in straight
rows. No standing around in a crowd, or lying down
in hammocks, or stretching out under trees for these
Tin Soldiers!</p>

<p>No, indeed! They stood up as straight and stiff as
their own guns!</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you like our drill and sham battle?&#8221;
asked the Bold Tin Soldier Captain of the Rag Doll,
strolling over to speak to her before going back to
join his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much, indeed,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;At
first I thought I might faint when the guns shot off,
but they were fired so gently that I did not, and
the Calico Clown did not have to catch me in his arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t let my Soldiers use too much
powder in their guns,&#8221; answered the Captain.
&#8220;It is a sort of tooth powder we use in these
make-believe fights, and then no one is hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be lonesome if you go away from us,&#8221;
said the Rag Doll, with a sigh, as she looked at the
Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for being so kind as to say that,&#8221;
said the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;But I have no notion
of going away until I have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he little knew what was going to happen nor
that he was to be taken away much sooner than he expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better be getting over to the box with
my Soldiers, I think,&#8221; said the Captain, as
he thrust his shiny sword back into the scabbard at
his side. &#8220;Our fun for to-night is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not quite yet,&#8221; said the Calico Clown.
&#8220;The sun has not yet risen, and it will be ten
minutes before the watchman comes in to turn out the
lights and get the store ready for the day&#8217;s
trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can be done in ten minutes?&#8221;
asked the Rag Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do a funny trick for you,&#8221; said
the Clown. &#8220;I have not yet done my share towards
the night&#8217;s fun, so I will do my trick now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to tell a joke or ask a riddle?&#8221;
inquired the Candy Rabbit. &#8220;If you are, I wish
you&#8217;d tell that one about what makes more noise
than a pig under a gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am going to do a funny trick. Do you
see that string there!&#8221; he asked the other toys,
pointing upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean the one hanging near the gas jet?&#8221;
asked the Box Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the Clown. &#8220;Well,
I am going to climb that string and hang by my toes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He quickly walked over to a long string that hung
down from the ceiling. At Christmas time it had held
some wreaths of holly, but now nothing was fast to
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up I go!&#8221; cried the Clown.</p>

<p>It was hard work for him to climb the string with
the cymbals fast on the ends of his arms, but he managed
to get up nearly as high as the flaming gas jet which
lighted the store at night, so the watchman could
see his way around.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s high enough&ndash;don&#8217;t go up
any farther!&#8221; cried the Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am high enough now,&#8221; said the
Clown. &#8220;Watch me hang by my toes!&#8221;</p>

<p>He began turning over as he clung to the string, and,
as he did so, he began to sway to and fro, like the
pendulum of a clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! Look out for the blazing gas light!
You&#8217;ll be burned!&#8221; suddenly called the
Rag Doll.</p>

<p>And as she spoke, the Clown on the dangling string
came too near the gas flame. His baggy trousers, one
leg red and the other yellow, began to smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the Calico Clown is burning! He will catch
fire!&#8221; cried the Candy Rabbit. &#8220;Will no
one save him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll save the Calico Clown!&#8221;
cried the Bold Tin Soldier, and he drew his shining
sword. &#8220;I will save him!&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch3"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER III</h1>

<h2 align="center">BOUGHT BY A BOY</h2>

<p>The toys were very much excited when they saw the
Calico Clown beginning to burn, because he had swung
too near the gas jet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t bear to look at him!&#8221;
cried the Rag Doll, covering her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right! The Bold Tin Soldier
is going to save him,&#8221; said the Monkey on a
Stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can he?&#8221; asked the Jumping Jack.
&#8221;How can the Captain get up there and save our Clown?
The string will not hold two!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, indeed, the Bold Tin Soldier himself was beginning
to wonder how he could save his toy friend. He could
not scramble up the string, as the Clown had done,
and, if he did, the Bold Captain might catch fire
himself.</p>

<p>Of course a tin soldier will not burn as quickly as
a Clown with a suit of cloth, but the gas flame was
very hot and dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down! Come down!&#8221; cried the Rag
Doll. &#8220;Come down, Mr. Calico Clown!&#8221;</p>

<p>And that, you would have thought, would have been
the easiest way for the comical chap to save himself&ndash;just
to slide down the string to the counter. But something
had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get down!&#8221; the Clown exclaimed.
&#8220;The string is twisted around my leg and caught
on one of my cymbals! I can&#8217;t get loose to come
down!&#8221; And that is what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;But still I will save him!&#8221; cried the
Bold Tin Soldier. He looked around the toy counter
and saw a sofa cushion that belonged to a large doll&#8217;s
parlor set. &#8220;Quick!&#8221; shouted the Captain.
&#8220;Put that cushion right under the Clown who
is dangling by the string. Then when he falls he will
not hurt himself. Over with the cushion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he can&#8217;t fall!&#8221; said the Jack
in the Box. &#8220;He&#8217;s all tangled up in the
string. He can&#8217;t get loose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him loose!&#8221; declared the
Captain. &#8220;Some of you shove that soft cushion
over under our Clown!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two Jacks, the Candy Rabbit and the Monkey on
a Stick pulled and hauled until the cushion was just
where the Clown would land if he let go of the string
and fell. But he was still tangled in the string,
and every time he swung, like the pendulum of the clock,
he came close to the burning gas jet. And each time
he did this his red and yellow trousers were scorched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, will no one save me?&#8221; cried the Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will!&#8221; shouted the Bold Tin Soldier.
&#8220;I am going to cut the string with my sword.
Then you will fall down, but you will not be hurt
because you will fall on the sofa cushion. I&#8217;ll
cut the string with my shiny tin sword, and then you
won&#8217;t be burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near the string which dangled from the ceiling was
a Japanese Juggler with a long ladder, which he could
climb, balancing a ball on the end of his nose. Just
now the Juggler was resting at the foot of the ladder
that stood upright. The Juggler did not speak English
very well, and that is why he did not understand all
that was going on. He had not said a word since the
Clown had climbed the string and had swung too near
the blazing gas jet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you allow me to use your ladder, Mr. Japanese
Juggler?&#8221; called the Bold Tin Soldier to the
chap with the ball on the end of his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without waiting for an answer, which he hardly
expected, the Captain sprang up the ladder, holding
his sword ready. In an instant he stood near the swaying,
swinging Clown who waved to and fro on the string.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swish! Swash!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the shiny tin sword sweeping through the
air. The string was sliced in two pieces.</p>

<p>The Clown was cut loose, and down he fell on the soft
sofa cushion, not being hurt at all. He was saved
from burning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray! Hurray for our brave Captain!&#8221;
cried all the toys, clapping their hands, and the
China Cat clapped his paws, which were just the same
as hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; asked the Bold Tin
Soldier after he had climbed down the ladder and hurried
over to where the Clown was getting up off the sofa
cushion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you! I am all right,&#8221; was
the answer. &#8220;I should not have tried to swing
by that string so near the burning gas. But I did not
think. Now, oh dear! Look at my trousers!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well might the clown say that, for his fine yellow
and red trousers were scorched and burned. It was
lucky the Clown himself was not burned, but it was
too bad his suit was spoiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear me! no one will ever buy me now,&#8221;
said the Clown sadly, looking at his legs. &#8220;I
am damaged! I&#8217;ll be thrown into the waste-paper
basket!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I could make you a new suit,&#8221;
said the Rag Doll. &#8220;I can sew a little, and
if I had some cloth I might at least put a patch over
the burned places if I shouldn&#8217;t have time for
a whole suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered the Clown. &#8220;But
I would never look the same. And thank you, Captain,
for cutting me down before I was burned,&#8221; he
went on to the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;It was very
brave of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was nothing,&#8221; the Captain modestly
said. &#8220;We soldiers are here to do just such
things as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; suddenly called the Monkey on
a Stick. &#8220;Here come the clerks. The store is
going to open!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so all the toys had to be quiet and go back to
their places. They could not make believe be alive
until night should come again.</p>

<p>One by one the girl clerks took their places behind
the toy counters near the shelves on which the different
playthings were stored. One girl picked up the Calico
Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do declare!&#8221; exclaimed this girl.
&#8220;Look at my fancy Clown, will you, Mabel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him, Sallie?&#8221;
asked the clerk whose name was Mabel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, his red and yellow pants are scorched,&#8221;
answered Sallie. &#8220;I wonder what happened to
him. Some customer who was smoking must have dropped
a match or some hot cigar ashes on him. I must tell
the manager about this. I can&#8217;t sell a damaged
toy like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Mabel, after
she had looked at the poor Calico Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I know what we can do!&#8221; the girl
clerk suddenly exclaimed.  &#8220;What?&#8221; asked
Sallie.</p>

<p>And &#8220;what?&#8221; wondered the Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can make him a new pair of trousers,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;Up in my locker I have some
pieces of silk I had left over when I dressed my little
sister&#8217;s doll for Christmas. I&#8217;ll get my
needle and thread and the pieces of silk, and this
noon, at lunch hour, we&#8217;ll make a new suit for
the Clown. Then he won&#8217;t be damaged, and you
can sell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be fine!&#8221; cried the other
girl, and the Clown, hearing this, felt much better.</p>

<p>By this time customers were coming into the store
to buy toys and other things, and the toy counters
and shelves were busy places. The Bold Tin Soldier
had gone back to his box with his men, and there he
and they stood, straight and stiff as ramrods, waiting
for what might happen to them.</p>

<p>All the toys wished to talk about the brave rescue
of the Calico Clown by the Captain, but of course
they had to keep still.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can talk about it to-night,&#8221; thought
the Candy Rabbit to himself. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have
a grand time when the store is once more closed. But
I hope the Clown does no more of his tricks. The next
time his jacket might burn, as well as his trousers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl who had promised to make a new pair of gay
silk trousers for the Clown was kept very busy that
morning waiting on customers. She had just sold a
little Celluloid Doll to a small girl when a boy and
a man came walking past the counter behind which she
stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s what I want, right over there!&#8221;
said the boy, pointing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the man, who seemed
to be his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;That set of soldiers,&#8221; went on the boy.
&#8220;I want that Bold Tin Soldier Captain, who carries
a sword, and I would like a set of his tin men. Then
Dick and I can play war and battle and have lots of
fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that set of toy soldiers will
cost too much,&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;You
know I said you could have a toy, but not one that
is too expensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s ask how much the tin soldiers
cost,&#8221; suggested the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That set costs two dollars,&#8221; answered
the girl behind the counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I said you could have only a dollar, Arnold,&#8221;
said the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a dollar of my own pocket money that
I have been saving,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;If
I put that with your dollar I&#8217;ll have two! Then
couldn&#8217;t I get the Captain and his men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you could,&#8221; answered the
man slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going to buy them!&#8221; exclaimed
the boy. &#8220;Hurray! I&#8217;m going to have a
Bold Tin Soldier and his men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now I suppose my adventures will begin,&#8221;
thought the Captain, for he heard all that was said.
&#8220;Like the Sawdust Doll, the White Rocking Horse,
and the Lamb on Wheels, I am to be sold and taken
away. Yes, now my adventures will begin!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl clerk went to get a piece of wrapping paper
in which to do up the box of soldiers. The boy and
his father stepped aside for a moment to look at some
other toys. As they were out of sight of the counter
for a few seconds, and as no one was watching, the
Calico Clown had a chance to whisper to the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are going away from us?&#8221; asked
the Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the Captain. &#8220;But
I am sorry I shall not see the new trousers the girl
is going to make for you. I would like to see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may come back and visit us,&#8221;
suggested the Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; agreed the Captain, and then
he had to stop talking for the boy and his father
came back.</p>

<a name="ch4"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER IV</h1>

<h2 align="center">A BEAN BATTLE</h2>

<p>&#8220;Well, Arnold, do you think you will like your
Bold Tin Soldier and his men?&#8221; asked the boy&#8217;s
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Daddy! I&#8217;m sure I shall!&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take them over to
Dick&#8217;s house, and we&#8217;ll have a make-believe
battle on the floor in the playroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is strange,&#8221; thought the tin Captain,
as the girl clerk was wrapping him and his men up
in a large paper. &#8220;Very strange! Where have
I heard those names before&ndash;Dick and Arnold? I wonder&ndash;I
wonder&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But just then the girl turned the box upside down
to tie a knot in the string she was putting around
it, and the Captain and his men had all they could
do to keep in their places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand fast, every one of you!&#8221; said the
Captain in a low voice to his tin men. &#8220;We are
perhaps going on a long trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy paid over his dollar of pocket money, his
father added another dollar, and then the box of toy
Tin Soldiers was taken away.</p>

<p>Just what happened on their trip from the store of
course the Captain and his men did not know. They
could feel themselves being jiggled about, and at
one time they were put on the seat of an automobile,
though they did not know it. And finally they were
set down with a jingle and a jangle, the guns of the
men rattling against the tin legs of the soldiers,
and the sword of the Captain tinkling in its scabbard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll have some fun with my Soldiers!&#8221;
cried the boy, whose name was Arnold.</p>

<p>The paper was taken off, the box was opened, and once
more the Bold Tin Soldier and his men saw the light
of day. They looked about them curiously.</p>

<p>The Captain and his men saw that they were in a pleasant,
sunny room. The box, which might have been called
their &#8220;barracks,&#8221; was on a table, and,
bending over it, was the boy, Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward&ndash;March!&#8221; called Arnold, and one
by one he took the Tin Soldiers out of the box and
set them in rows on the table, with the Captain at
the head of his men. That is the proper place for a
Captain, you know.</p>

<p>Of course if Arnold had not been there, and if no
other human eyes had been looking at the Tin Soldiers,
they could have marched out of the box by themselves.
But, as it was, Arnold had to lift them out. He did
not know, of course, that his toys, and all other toys,
have the power of pretending they are alive at certain
times.</p>

<p>As Arnold was standing his Soldiers in rows on the
table, the door of the room opened and a little girl
came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Arnold! what did you get?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t they nice!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are my new Soldiers, Mirabell,&#8221;
said the boy. &#8220;Daddy took me to the store and
I bought them with some of my pocket money. But Daddy
gave me a dollar, too. Want to see my Soldiers fight?&#8221;
asked Arnold, as he stood the Corporal and the Sergeant
where they could help the Captain take charge of the
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Arnold! I don&#8217;t want to see any
soldiers fight! They might shoot me!&#8221; cried
the little girl, pretending to shiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope! They won&#8217;t shoot anybody!&#8221;
said Arnold. &#8220;They have only make-believe guns,
and I&#8217;ll only make-believe shoot &#8217;em. I
yell &#8217;Bang! Bang!&#8217; and that&#8217;s all
the shooting there is. Now watch, Mirabell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy divided the tin toys into two companies, just
as the tin Captain himself had done with his men when
he gave the fancy drill on the counter before the
Calico Clown swung from the string and nearly caught
fire. One of the companies was commanded by the Captain,
while the Sergeant, who had red stripes on his sleeves,
was in charge of the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the battle!&#8221; cried the boy. &#8220;Ready!
Aim! Fire! Bang! Bang!&#8221; And he yelled so loudly
that his sister Mirabell put her hands over her ears,
just as, in the store, the Rag Doll had covered her
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy, don&#8217;t shout so loud, Arnold!&#8221;
cried Mirabell. &#8220;Oh, not so loud!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to. This is a big fight!&#8221; the
boy answered. &#8220;Bang! Bang! Bang!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he knocked some of the soldiers over, pretending
they had fallen in battle, and he moved some forward
across the table and some he moved back.</p>

<p>&#8220;One side is winning and the other side is losing,&#8221;
said the boy. &#8220;The losing side is running away.
Bang! Bang! Bang!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too much for me!&#8221; said Mirabell.
&#8220;There is too much bang-banging. I&#8217;m
going to play with my Lamb on Wheels.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bold Tin Soldier Captain heard Mirabell say that,
even above the noise made by Arnold.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/illus-01.png"><img src="images/illus-01.png" width="50%" border="0" alt="&#8220;I Just Arrived,&#8221; Answered the Bold Tin Soldier."></a><br>
&#8220;I Just Arrived,&#8221; Answered the Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Now I know where I heard those names before!&#8221;
thought the Captain. &#8220;The Sawdust Doll told
us about these children when she came back to the
store to visit that day. They live next door to Dick
and Dorothy. Oh, I am in good company!&#8221;</p>

<p>Back and forth across the table the boy moved his
two companies of Tin Soldiers. Sometimes he would
make believe one side was winning the battle, and
again he would let the other side seem to win.</p>

<p>The Captain and his men had little to say about it,
for they could not move by themselves nor talk when
Arnold was looking at them. And when he and his men
were being moved back by the boy, and losing the pretend
battle to the Sergeant and his men, the Captain sighed
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if we could only do as we pleased! Then
I&#8217;d show this boy how a real Tin Soldier can
fight!&#8221;</p>

<p>But of course the Captain could not do that. He had
to be content to let Arnold move him about. And the
boy had fun with his company of Tin Soldiers.</p>

<p>He fought several battles with them, but at last,
like all boys, he wanted to do something else. He
was just wondering what he could do when the door
opened, and Mirabell came in dragging behind her a
rather large, woolly Lamb on Wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on out on the porch and play with me!&#8221;
begged Mirabell of her brother. &#8220;It is nice
out there, and you can bring your Soldiers with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so I can,&#8221; said Arnold. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
do it. Wait until I get the little wooden cannon that
shoots paper bullets. I&#8217;ll put that in the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll get my little Wooden Doll and
pretend she is a Red Cross Nurse,&#8221; said Mirabell.</p>

<p>Together the children ran from the room, leaving the
Tin Soldiers on the table and the Lamb on Wheels on
the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all things!&#8221; bleated the Lamb,
when she saw the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;Just fancy
seeing you again! When did you get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just arrived,&#8221; answered the Captain,
for, there being no one in the room then, he and the
Lamb could talk and move by themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you are here,&#8221; went
on the woolly pet &#8220;Tell me all that has happened
at the store since I was taken away. Is the Candy
Rabbit there yet? And the Monkey on a Stick and the
Calico Clown? Are they all there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But the Clown had a sad accident just
before I came away,&#8221; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, how dreadful! Was he hurt?&#8221;
eagerly asked the Lamb on Wheels, rolling over a little
closer to the table on which stood the Tin Soldiers
and their Captain. None of the Soldiers spoke while
their Captain was talking, as that was not considered
polite.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the Clown wasn&#8217;t exactly hurt,&#8221;
said the Captain, &#8220;but his trousers were scorched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, his lovely red and yellow trousers!&#8221;
bleated the Lamb. &#8220;How sad! Tell me about it,
please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, the Clown was doing a few tricks
to amuse us, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, sir! Quiet if you please, sir!&#8221;
exclaimed the Sergeant, saluting his Captain. &#8220;Some
one is coming, sir! I hear them, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>And just then the door opened and Mirabell and Arnold
came running back into the room, the boy carrying
a little wooden cannon and his sister with a Wooden
Doll in her hand&ndash;the doll that was to be a Red Cross
Nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Arnold! Look!&#8221; cried Mirabell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked her brother,
as he began gathering up the Tin Soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, look at my Lamb on Wheels!&#8221; went
on Mirabell. &#8220;I left her over by the door, and
now she has rolled over near the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the wind must have blown her,&#8221;
said Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the door wasn&#8217;t open, nor the windows,&#8221;
went on Mirabell. &#8220;So how could the wind blow
her? Oh, Arnold, once before my Lamb moved when I
left her alone! Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if she
could really be alive and move by herself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it would,&#8221; admitted Arnold. &#8220;But
your Lamb can&#8217;t move by herself any more than
my Tin Soldiers can.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he little knew what went on after dark, when
he and Mirabell were asleep in bed, did he?</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll go out on the porch and have
some fun,&#8221; said Arnold, putting his Soldiers
back in their box.</p>

<p>It was a warm, sunny day, and soon the two children
were having a good time out on the porch of their
house. Arnold set his Soldiers in two rows, with the
Captain at the head of one row and the Sergeant at
the head of the other. Then the boy put some paper
bullets in his toy, wooden cannon, and Mirabell wheeled
her Lamb to a safe place.</p>

<p>Arnold was just going to shoot his cannon and pretend
to have the tin guns of the Soldiers go bang-bang
when, all at once, a shower of hard, dried beans fell
on the porch. Some struck the Soldiers, some hit the
Red Cross Doll, and some pattered on Mirabell and Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, some one is shooting bean bullets at us!&#8221;
cried the little girl. &#8220;This is a bean battle!
Are your Tin Soldiers shooting bean bullets, Arnold?&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch5"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER V</h1>

<h2 align="center">THE CAPTAIN AND THE LAMB</h2>

<p>For a few seconds Arnold did not know what to answer.
One of the hard, dried beans had struck him on the
nose, and, while it did not hurt very much, it made
his eyes water and he could not see what was happening.</p>

<p>But the beans kept on falling about the porch, and
one struck a Tin Soldier and knocked him over. This
Soldier was a very small chap. He was, in fact, the
drummer boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who is shooting the beans at us?&#8221;
cried Mirabell, as she lay down on the porch behind
her Lamb on Wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who is pegging beans at
us,&#8221; said Arnold, looking around and out toward
the street. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t my Soldiers, for
their tin guns can only make believe shoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then some shouts were heard and more beans came
rattling across the porch, some, once more, hitting
the Lamb, Arnold, and the Tin Soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look, Arnold!&#8221; suddenly called his
sister. &#8220;I see who is doing it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot of rough boys! Look! They, have bean-blowers!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke more shouts sounded and more beans came
flying swiftly over the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot the Tin Soldiers! Shoot the Tin Soldiers!&#8221;
cried the rough boys. There were three of them, and,
as Mirabell had said, they had long tin bean, or putty,
blowers. They were blowing the beans at the boy and
his sister on the porch.</p>

<p>Rattle and bang went the hard dried beans, but the
Bold Tin Soldier Captain and his men stood bravely
up under the shower of bean bullets. The Red Cross
Nurse Doll was brave, too, and did not run away, while
the Lamb on Wheels stood on her wooden platform and
never so much as blinked an eye as bean after bean
struck her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot the Tin Soldiers! Shoot the woolly Lamb!&#8221;
cried the bad boys, as they, blew more beans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! You stop shooting beans at us!&#8221;
cried Arnold. &#8220;Do you hear me? You stop it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho! We won&#8217;t stop for you! You can&#8217;t
make us!&#8221; shouted the boys, and they were going
to blow more beans, but just then Patrick, the gardener
next door, came along with some seeds he had been down
to the store to buy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patrick!&#8221; called Mirabell.</p>

<p>Patrick saw the bad boys blowing beans at Mirabell
and Arnold, and, with a shout, the gardener chased
the unpleasant lads away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be off out of here and let my children alone!&#8221;
cried Patrick, for he considered Dorothy and Dick
and Arnold and Mirabell as his special &#8220;children,&#8221;
and was always watching to see that no harm came to
them. And once Patrick had saved the Lamb on Wheels,
as you may read in the book written specially about
that toy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they hurt you, Mirabell or Arnold?&#8221;
asked the gardener, as he came back from chasing the
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, not much,&#8221; Arnold answered.
&#8220;One bean struck me on the nose, but it didn&#8217;t
hurt&ndash;hardly any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And one bean knocked over one of your Soldiers,
Arnold,&#8221; said Mirabell.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the drummer boy&ndash;I guess he isn&#8217;t
hurt any,&#8221; returned the boy, and he set the
Tin Drummer on his feet again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well! You have a fine regiment of soldiers,
there!&#8221; said Patrick. &#8220;A fine regiment.
What are you going to do with &#8217;em, Arnold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a make-believe battle,
now that the boys with the beans have gone away,&#8221;
Arnold replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my Wooden Doll is going to be a Bed Cross
Nurse,&#8221; added Mirabell. &#8220;And if any of
the Soldiers get hurt I&#8217;ll give them a ride
on the back of my Lamb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure and you&#8217;ll have dandy times!&#8221;
laughed Patrick.</p>

<p>Then Arnold and Mirabell had fun playing on the porch
with the Tin Soldiers, the wooden cannon, the Doll
and the Lamb on Wheels. Back and forth Arnold marched
his two companies of Soldiers, firing the make-believe
guns in regular bang-bang style.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would pretend a Soldier was wounded,
though, of course, none of them really was, and Mirabell
would make the Red Cross Nurse Doll look after the
injured. And when the battle was nearly over Arnold
made believe that a dozen or more of his Tin Soldiers
were hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my Doll nurse can&#8217;t look after so
many hurt soldiers!&#8221; objected the little girl.
&#8220;There&#8217;s too many!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put &#8217;em on the back of your Lamb and
make believe it&#8217;s an ambulance,&#8221; said
Arnold, and Mirabell did this.</p>

<p>So the two children continued to play together with
Arnold&#8217;s new soldier toys. And then, just as
the last bang-bang gun was fired, Susan, the jolly,
good-natured cook, called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, children! I have a little pie I baked
especially for you two. It is just out of the oven!
Come and get some while it is hot!&#8221;</p>

<p>And you may well believe that Mirabell and Arnold
did not wait&ndash;they ran at once, leaving their toys
on the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now we have a chance to rest,&#8221;
said the Bold Tin Soldier Captain to his men. &#8220;Whew!
that battle was surely as lively as the one we had
in the store the other night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; agreed the Sergeant.
&#8220;The bayonet on my gun is bent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that shows you have been to war,&#8221;
said the Captain. &#8220;And now we must thank the
Red Cross Doll and the Lamb on Wheels for what they
did for us during the make-believe fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t do much,&#8221; cried the
Wooden Doll, with a laugh. &#8220;None of you was
really hurt, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; agreed the Captain. &#8220;But
if we had really been wounded you would have helped
us, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted the Doll, &#8220;I surely
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I was only too glad to have you ride on
my back,&#8221; said the Lamb on Wheels. &#8220;It
is so good to meet you again, Captain,&#8221; she went
on. &#8220;Quite like old times. We have a few minutes
now, while the children are away, getting their pie.
Do tell me what happened to the Calico Clown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His trousers were burned,&#8221; said the Captain.
&#8220;And because Arnold bought me and my men I had
to leave the store before I could see the new trousers
the girl was going to make. But I&#8217;ll tell you
all about it,&#8221; and the Bold Tin Soldier did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he ever tell the answer to that riddle
of what it is that makes more noise than a pig under
a gate?&#8221; asked the Lamb.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he never did,&#8221; said the Captain.
&#8220;I meant to ask him, but I came away in a hurry,
you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we toys don&#8217;t generally have much
say as to what we shall or shall not do,&#8221; bleated
the Lamb. &#8220;I have been puzzling over that riddle
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The next time I see the Calico Clown I will
ask him the answer,&#8221; declared the Captain. &#8220;There
is no need of making such a secret about it. But,
speaking of the store, it was lonesome there after
you and the Sawdust Doll and the White Rocking Horse
came away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? Did you miss me?&#8221; asked the Lamb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed we did,&#8221; declared the Captain.
&#8220;And, in a way, I am glad I was bought and brought
away. One reason is that now I may have some adventures,
and another reason is that I have seen you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very nice of you to say that,&#8221;
said the Lamb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any chance of seeing the Sawdust Doll
or the White Rocking Horse again?&#8221; asked the
Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! Every chance in the world,&#8221;
was the Lamb&#8217;s answer. &#8220;Why, they only
live next door. The Sawdust Doll belongs to a little
girl named Dorothy, and the White Rocking Horse to
a boy named Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Wooden Doll, who was a Red Cross Nurse, the
Lamb on Wheels and the Bold Tin Soldier and his Tin
Men talked together for some little time longer, while
Arnold and Mirabell were in the kitchen eating the
pie Susan had so kindly baked for them.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as the Lamb was telling the Soldier
some of her adventures, and how she had floated downstream
on a raft, something fluttered down out of a tree
near the porch, and the Lamb cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; asked the Bold Tin
Soldier. &#8220;Did a bee sting you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that was a bird!&#8221; bleated the Lamb
on Wheels. &#8220;And did you see what he did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! what?&#8221; asked the Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that bird flew right down out of a tree
and grabbed a beak full of wool off my back,&#8221;
went on the Lamb. &#8220;Gracious, how he pulled!&#8221;</p>

<p>And while the Captain was getting ready to say something,
down flew the bird again, and he plucked another beak
full of loose, soft wool, pulling it from the Lamb&#8217;s
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch! Oh, how you pull! Please stop!&#8221;
bleated the Lamb.</p>

<p>The Bold Tin Soldier drew his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Bird!&#8221; cried the Captain.
&#8220;I do not want to hurt you, but I can not allow
you to pull wool from the back of my friend, Miss
Lamb. You must stop it, or I will drive you away with
my shiny, tin sword, as I drove away the bad rat that
wanted to nibble the ears of the Candy Rabbit! Stop
it, Mr. Bird!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!&#8221; chirped the Bird.
&#8220;Please let me pull some more wool from your
back, Miss Lamb,&#8221; and he fluttered in the air
with his beak wide open, while the Bold Tin Soldier,
with drawn sword, took a step forward.</p>

<p>What was going to happen?</p>

<a name="ch6"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER VI</h1>

<h2 align="center">SAVING THE SAWDUST DOLL</h2>

<p>The bird was just going to flutter down and pull some
more wool from the back of the Lamb on Wheels, when
the Bold Tin Soldier, waving his sword, happened to
strike it on the iron wheels of the wooden platform
on which Miss Lamb stood. The shiny sword made a clanking
sound, and, hearing this, the bird, instead of fluttering
to the Lamb&#8217;s back, perched on the porch railing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better not come and pull
any more wool from my friend, Miss Lamb!&#8221; said
the Soldier Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please excuse me!&#8221; chirped the bird.
&#8220;Oh, what a mistake I have made! Why, you are
only a <i>toy</i> lamb, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
he asked the plaything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am a toy,&#8221; answered the Lamb
on Wheels. &#8220;But I can talk and move around when
no human eyes watch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the trouble,&#8221; said
the bird. &#8220;I took you for a <i>real</i>
lamb, and that is why I pulled some wool from your
back. I wouldn&#8217;t have done it for the world
if I had known you were a toy! Please excuse me. I
made a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; asked the Bold Tin
Soldier, &#8220;that you could pull wool from the
back of a real, live lamb?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I could!&#8221; chirped the bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; asked the Wooden Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;To line my nest with, of course,&#8221; answered
Mr. Bird. &#8220;You see I am helping my wife make
a nest. She is going to lay eggs in it and hatch out
baby birds. And we want the nest nice and soft for
the little ones. So, when I saw the woolly Lamb here
on the porch, I flew down to pick some soft stuff
from her back. I never thought she was a <i>toy</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t the real lambs mind if you pull
wool from their backs?&#8221; asked the Wooden Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;The
real lambs, down in the green pasture by the brook,
often have loose bits of wool on their backs. Other
birds and I fly down, take off the loose pieces, and
line our nests with them. Sometimes, when I can not
get wool, I take the soft fluffy cotton from the milkweed
plant, but I like lambs&#8217; fleece the best. It
is so soft and warm for the little birds. But don&#8217;t
worry, Miss Lamb, I will not bother you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry I can not let you have more of my
wool,&#8221; went on the Lamb on Wheels. &#8220;But,
you see, not being real, my wool is glued fast  to
my back, and every time you take some off it pulls.
And I can&#8217;t grow any more like a real lamb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; chirped the bird. &#8220;Well,
now I will fly to the green meadow and get some wool
from a real lamb. Please forgive me, friends, for
making trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the
Bold Tin Soldier, putting away his shiny sword.</p>

<p>So, when the bird had flown away, the three toys were
happy together again&ndash;the Bold Tin Soldier Captain,
the Lamb on Wheels, and the Wooden Doll. Then the
children came back to have more fun, and the toys
had to be very still and quiet, moving about only as
Arnold or Mirabell moved them.</p>

<p>When supper time came Arnold put his Tin Soldiers
back in their box, and set them away on a shelf in
the dark closet. He also put his wooden cannon there,
while Mirabell put her Doll and other toys on the
floor of the closet, as she could not quite reach up
to the shelf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you are going to like it here,
Captain?&#8221; asked one of the Tin Soldiers, when
the closet door was shut and the toys could do as
they pleased, since no eyes could see them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think this will be a nice place,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;Arnold is going to be kind
to us, I can see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, he is a fine boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you would like being
made to fight so often,&#8221; said the Wooden Doll.
&#8220;Dear me, you seem to do nothing but go into
battle and shoot your guns or draw your swords!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a soldier&#8217;s life,&#8221; said
the Captain. &#8220;That is what we were made for,
to fight and protect the weak. If ever you need our
help, just call on us, Miss Doll.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning Arnold opened the closet and took
out his box of Tin Soldiers where they stood in their
places straight and stiff, with their Captain at their
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do, Arnold?&#8221; asked
Mirabell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to Dick&#8217;s house
to have some fun,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I will
let him play with my Soldiers, and he will let me ride
on his White Rocking Horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then I&#8217;m going over and take my Lamb!&#8221;
exclaimed Mirabell. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let Dorothy
play with her, and maybe she&#8217;ll let me take her
Sawdust Doll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on. We&#8217;ll have lots of fun,&#8221;
said Arnold.</p>

<p>So the children, with their toys, went next door to
the house where Dick and Dorothy lived. Mirabell and
Arnold found their friends out on the lawn, and Dick
had his Rocking Horse while Dorothy was playing with
her Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now we will have some dandy fun!&#8221;
cried Dick. &#8220;Let me see your new Tin Soldiers,
Arnold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grass was nice and smooth, and soon the Bold Tin
Captain and his men were set up in rows, just as if
they were on parade. Dick took half the Tin Soldiers
and Arnold the other half, and then the little boys
pretended to have a battle, only, of course, no one
was hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ride your Rocking Horse?&#8221; asked
Arnold, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; answered Dick. &#8220;You
take a nice, long ride, while I play with your Soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>And while this was going on Mirabell and Dorothy played
with the Sawdust Doll and the Lamb on Wheels. And
how the toys did wish they were alone, so they could
talk to one another! Of course the Sawdust Doll and
the Rocking Horse, living in the same house, saw each
other very often, and at night they could talk and
play together. But it had been some time since either
of them had seen the Bold Tin Soldier and his men,
and the Doll and Horse were very anxious to hear the
news from the store.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear!&#8221; whispered the Lamb on Wheels
to the Sawdust Doll, when they had a chance to talk
together alone for a moment, which was when Dorothy
and Mirabell went into the house to get some crackers
for a play party, &#8220;you have no idea what an exciting
story the Bold Tin Soldier has to tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; asked the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;About how he saved the Calico Clown,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;He&#8217;ll tell you about
it when he has the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to hear it,&#8221; said the
Sawdust Doll. &#8220;But I hope nothing serious happened
to the Clown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But it might have,&#8221; answered the
Lamb. &#8220;Hush! Here come the children back. We
may not talk any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a little later on there was a chance for all four
of the toys to talk among themselves. And there was
quite an adventure, too, for the Bold Tin Soldier
and the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>After they had played for some time, Dorothy and Mirabell
and Dick and Arnold saw Patrick, the gardener, get
out the hose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, may we sprinkle a little?&#8221; cried
Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, please let us squirt some water on the
flowers,&#8221; begged Dorothy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll be very careful not to get
wet you may,&#8221; said Patrick.</p>

<p>Over the lawn ran the four children, leaving their
toys on the grass. And, seeing this, the Bold Tin
Soldier said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now we have a chance to do as we please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must please tell me how you saved
the Calico Clown,&#8221; begged the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shiver my sword!&#8221; cried the Soldier,
laughing, &#8220;have you heard that story, also?
It was nothing&ndash;just a little happening. We soldiers
must do our duty, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but tell me about it,&#8221; begged the
Doll, and the Captain did.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, how brave you are!&#8221; said the Sawdust
Doll, when he had finished. &#8220;And now tell me
about the Candy Rabbit, the Monkey on a Stick, the
Elephant on Roller Skates, and all the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do tell her,&#8221; urged the Lamb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I want to hear about the Elephant,&#8221;
said the White Rocking Horse. &#8220;He tried to race
with me once. Ha! Ha! That was funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Bold Tin Soldier told of the happenings in
the toy department of the store, and the toys were
having a good time among themselves when, all of a
sudden, into the yard ran a big dog. He was much larger
than Carlo, the poodle dog that had once carried off
the Sawdust Doll in his mouth.</p>

<p>With a wiff-wuffing bark this dog ran right among
the toys who were talking together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear me!&#8221; cried the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! what is the matter with you?&#8221; asked
the dog, who was neither very good nor very polite.
&#8220;What are you &#8216;oh dearing&#8217; about?
I guess I&#8217;ll just take you home to let my puppies
play with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang towards the Sawdust Doll and was just going
to pick her up in his mouth, when the Bold Tin Soldier
drew his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep away from my friend, the Sawdust Doll!&#8221;
cried the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says so?&#8221; barked the big dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; answered the Tin Soldier. &#8220;I
will save the Sawdust Doll from being carried away!&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch7"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER VII</h1>

<h2 align="center">A SAD ACCIDENT</h2>

<p>If the big dog had not been so gruff and impolite,
and if he had known how truly brave the Bold Tin Soldier
was, the barking chap never would have tried to do
what he said he was going to do&ndash;carry away the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am going to take the Sawdust Doll home
to my kennel, so my little puppies will have something
to gnaw and to play with,&#8221; went on the big dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just fancy!&#8221; exclaimed the poor Doll.
&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to be gnawed and played
with by any puppies! They may bite holes in me, and
all my sawdust will run out I Oh dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; replied the Bold
Tin Soldier. &#8220;This dog shall not take you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bow wow! You just watch me!&#8221; barked the
bad dog. He ran at the Sawdust Doll with wide-open
mouth, but before he could pick her up to carry her
away the Bold Tin Soldier thrust his sword at the dog
and pricked him on the paw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch! Oh, dear! I must have run a thorn into
my foot!&#8221; howled the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it was not a thorn. It was my sword that
pricked you,&#8221; said the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;I
only stuck you a little bit this first time, but if
you keep on teasing my friend, Miss Sawdust Doll, I
shall have to do something worse. You had better run
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I had,&#8221; howled the dog.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know your sword was so sharp.
Ouch, my paw hurts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am sorry I had to hurt you,&#8221;
said the Captain. &#8220;But if you had behaved yourself
it would not have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put a grass poultice on it,&#8221;
said the Sawdust Doll. &#8220;I know something about
nursing, for once in a while Dorothy pretends I am
in a hospital. I&#8217;ll bind some grass on your foot,
Mr. Dog, if you will promise to let me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; was the barking
answer. &#8220;And I am sorry I was so unkind to you.
Please forgive me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sawdust Doll said she would. Then the Bold Tin
Soldier, with the same sword that had pricked the
dog, cut some grass, and it was bound on the dog&#8217;s
paw. The sword prick was not a very deep one, and
would soon heal. Then, limping on three legs, the dog
ran away, and the toys were left to themselves once
more.</p>

<p>By this time Patrick had let the children do all the
hose sprinkling he thought was good for them, so back
came running Dick and Dorothy, Arnold and Mirabell,
to play with their toys again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we play now?&#8221; asked Dick of
Arnold. &#8220;Shall we have another battle with the
Tin Soldiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the garage and play we&#8217;re
going on an automobile trip,&#8221; said Arnold. &#8220;We
have had enough battles today.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Captain and his men were put back in their
box and the cover was closed down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; thought the Lamb on Wheels.
&#8220;Now if anything happens, such as a big dog
coming again, the Captain can not save us. He can
not get out of the box.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Lamb need not have worried, for she was taken
into the house by Mirabell, and so was the Sawdust
Doll and the Rocking Horse. The little girls went
down the street to play with a friend named Madeline,
leaving their own toys in Dorothy&#8217;s house, while
Dick and Arnold went out to the garage, and from there
over to Arnold&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>But though no big dog came into the home of Dick and
Dorothy to carry away the Sawdust Doll, something
else happened, almost as bad, at least for the Bold
Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>He and his men had been put in their box, and the
box was put on a table in the playroom, together with
the Lamb on Wheels, the Sawdust Doll and the White
Rocking Horse. When Arnold and Mirabell went home
they would take the Soldiers and the Lamb with them.</p>

<p>But before this came about something happened. A lady
came to call on Dorothy&#8217;s mother, bringing with
her a little boy named Tad. Now Tad was not a bad
little boy, but he was always looking for something
to play with and he was not careful.</p>

<p>When Tad reached the home of Dick and Dorothy and
found neither of the children was in, and when he
saw his mother and Dorothy&#8217;s mother talking
together, Tad wandered about by himself to find something
with which he could have fun. And the first thing he
saw was the box of Tin Soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now I can have some fun!&#8221; cried Tad.</p>

<p>He opened the box and took out the Bold Tin Captain.
Then he took out the other Soldiers, the Sergeant,
the Corporal and all the men.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8217;Ha! Now I can have a battle!&#8217;&#8217;
cried Tad, and he threw all the Soldiers in a heap
on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my, this little fellow is a dreadful chap!&#8221;
thought the Captain. &#8220;If he isn&#8217;t careful
he will break some of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we don&#8217;t belong to him!&#8221;
thought the Sergeant.</p>

<p>Still the Soldiers could do nothing, nor could they
say anything, as Tad was there looking at them with
his big, blue eyes. And Tad did more than look. He
handled the Tin Soldiers very roughly.</p>

<p>The carpet was so soft that when they were thrown
out of their box they were not hurt, but as Tad grew
rougher and rougher as he handled the Captain and
his men, the Bold Tin Soldier began to be very much
worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up there!&#8221; cried Tad, and he jabbed
the Soldiers, one after the other, down very hard
on the carpet. Now the carpet, being soft and thick,
was not a very good place for the Soldiers to stand
on. They fell over very easily, and, seeing this,
Tad cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up there!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the Soldiers kept falling over&ndash;since they
dared not spread their legs and act as if they were
alive when any human eyes were watching them&ndash;Tad
cried impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re no good! I&#8217;m not going
to play with you! I&#8217;m going to have some other
fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a sweep of his hand he sent the Soldiers in a
heap together. Some fell one way and some another,
and the Captain bounced out to the middle of the floor
where Tad let him lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll ride on the Rocking Horse!&#8221;
cried this not-very-good little boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me! now I am in for a time,&#8221;
thought the White Horse. &#8220;This little lad is
as rough as the one who used to dig his heels into
my sides when he jumped on my back in the store. Oh,
there he comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, surely enough, Tad ran across the room and climbed
up on the back of the White Rocking Horse. If the
Horse could have had his way he would have turned
and galloped out of the room. But he could not do
this, and so he just had to stand there and take what
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gid-dap, there! Gid-dap!&#8221; cried Tad,
banging his heels against the sides of the White Rocking
Horse.</p>

<p>Now, as I have told you, when the Horse was made to
rock back and forth he traveled along, just as sometimes
a rocking chair moves across the room. And the faster
Tad made the horse sway to and fro, the more the wooden
toy moved along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really having a ride!&#8221;
cried Tad. &#8220;This is fun! Gid-dap, White Rocking
Horse!&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the room on the soft carpet rocked the Horse,
straight toward the Bold Tin Soldier who was lying
in the middle of the room. And in a few moments, unless
Tad stopped rocking the Horse, he would run over his
friend, the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gid-dap! Gid-dap!&#8221; shouted Tad.</p>

<p>The Horse saw what was going to happen, and so did
the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I can only get out of the way!&#8221;
thought the Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if only I do not have to rock on my bold
friend!&#8221; thought the White Horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gid-dap! Gid-dap!&#8221; cried Tad again, and
he made the Horse go faster and faster.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the rockers went to the Bold Tin
Soldier. He wanted to shout aloud, but that was against
the rules. And the Horse wanted to stop and turn about,
and that, also, was against the rules, as long as
Tad was there. As for the boy himself, I don&#8217;t
really believe he would have done it if he had seen
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>But he was so excited at being on the back of the
Horse that he did not look down at the floor where
the Bold Tin Soldier lay. And a moment later the Horse
rocked, with a crunching sound, right over his friend!</p>

<a name="ch8"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER VIII</h1>

<h2 align="center">A BUNCH OF SWEETNESS</h2>

<p>The Bold Tin Soldier wanted to shout aloud and yell
when he felt the rockers of the White Rocking Horse
going over him. But he was a truly brave chap, and
he knew it would never do to let that careless boy
Tad know a Tin Soldier could pretend to be alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not say a word!&#8221; thought the Soldier
to himself.</p>

<p>And you can just imagine how the White Rocking Horse
felt when he was made to run over his dear friend
from the toy store!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me,&#8221; said the White Rocking
Horse to himself, when he heard the crunching sound,
&#8220;something dreadful has happened! But it was
not my fault! It was that boy&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>For you know, as well as I do, that if the White Rocking
Horse had had his way he would have turned out, and
not have gone over his friend, the Captain.</p>

<p>But Tad did not stop rocking, even when he heard the
crunching sound. He swayed backward and forward in
the saddle and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gid-dap! Go faster!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he made the White Rocking Horse keep on. I don&#8217;t
know what else would have happened. Maybe that careless
boy would have rocked over the rest of the Tin Soldiers
for all I know, only he happened to see the Lamb on
Wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull her around. That will be fun,&#8221;
said Tad, springing off the back of the horse.</p>

<p>As the boy leaped from the back of the White Rocking
Horse he turned that wooden chap half around so the
animal could look at the Bold Tin Soldier lying on
the carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor friend!&#8221; thought the White
Rocking Horse, not daring to speak out loud, of course.
&#8220;I hope you are not killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I am glad to say that the Tin Soldier Captain
was not. He was not even hurt, for the rocker of the
horse had gone over his sword, instead of over one
of the legs or arms of the toy chap. The Soldier&#8217;s
sword had been run over and broken off, scabbard and
all. And the scabbard, or case in which the sword
was kept, and the sword itself were lying on the floor,
not far from the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, what a sad accident!&#8221; thought
the White Rocking Horse.</p>

<p>And the Bold Tin Soldier was thinking to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is lucky I am not hurt, but it is
dreadful to have my sword broken off. My men may think
I am no longer their captain, and they may not obey
me. Oh, dear, I am no good any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if the rough boy will break me?&#8221;
thought the Lamb on Wheels, as Tad dragged her around
the room.</p>

<p>But Tad seemed more gentle with the Lamb, or else
perhaps he was tired of playing with the toys. For
all he did was to drag the woolly plaything around
the room a few times, and then he let go the string.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry!&#8221; said Tad out loud.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get my mother to ask Dorothy&#8217;s
mother to give me something to eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the room ran the boy, and all the toys breathed
easier when they saw him go.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor, dear friend!&#8221; exclaimed the
Rocking Horse, as he slowly made his way over to where
the Tin Soldier lay on the carpet. &#8220;I hope you
will forgive me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not your fault at all!&#8221; said the
Soldier. &#8220;It could not be helped. It is the
fortune of war, as we men of the army say. My sword
is broken, that is true, but it is much better to bear
that than to put up with a broken arm or leg. Perhaps
I can be mended.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up the sword which had been broken off from
his tin side where it had been soldered, or fastened.
He tried to make it stick on, but it was of no use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Captain,&#8221; said the Corporal
from the floor where he lay in a heap with the other
soldiers, &#8220;we think just as much of you as before.
You are still our commander, sword or no sword!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to have you say that,&#8221; returned
the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;Dear me, what a day it
has been!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still holding the broken sword in his hand
when the door opened again and some one came rushing
in. The Soldier had to drop back on the carpet, letting
his broken sword fall where it would, and neither
the Horse nor the other toys could speak again for
a time.</p>

<p>And then a voice said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look at my nice Soldiers on the floor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Captain&#8217;s sword is broken!&#8221;
said another voice. &#8220;Oh, who do you suppose
did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Dick and Arnold who had come into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; asked Dick&#8217;s
mother, coming up to the playroom just then. &#8220;Has
anything happened?&#8221;</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/illus-02.png"><img src="images/illus-02.png" width="50%" border="0" alt="&#8220;It Was Not Your Fault,&#8221; Said the Soldier."></a><br>
&#8220;It Was Not Your Fault,&#8221; Said the Soldier.</p>

<p>Then the boys showed the sword broken from the side
of the brave Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tad must have done that!&#8221; said Dick&#8217;s
mother. &#8220;He was up here while his mother and
I were talking downstairs. Oh, I am so sorry! But I
will have your Soldier mended, Arnold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Patrick,
our gardener, is very good at soldering things. Once
he soldered a hole in my dishpan. I will get him to
fasten on the sword which is broken from your Tin Captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patrick was called in. The gardener, who did many
things around the big house besides watering the lawn
and looking after the flowers, took the Bold Tin Soldier
and the broken sword up in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can he be mended?&#8221; asked Dick&#8217;s
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I think so,&#8221; answered Patrick.</p>

<p>&#8220;And may we watch you mend him?&#8221; asked
Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;May we, Patrick?&#8221; echoed Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the good-natured gardener.
&#8220;Come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>Back to the garage he went where he had been mending
something that was broken on the automobile, taking
the Tin Soldier with him and followed by the two boys.
Patrick heated a soldering iron in a little furnace
in which burned glowing charcoal. Then Patrick took
some shining metal that looked like silver, but which
was really soft lead.</p>

<p>Solder melts easily, and when some is placed on two
pieces of broken tin and heated, it holds together
the two pieces of tin just as glue  holds together
pieces of cardboard or paper.</p>

<p>In a little while the Bold Tin Soldier was mended,
and there he stood, straight and stiff, with his sword
at his side as before. And where the sword had been
soldered on a tiny spot of bright lead showed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can paint that spot over for you tomorrow,
when I have some red paint,&#8221; said Patrick to
Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what I can do I&#8221; cried Arnold,
looking at the shiny spot of lead. &#8220;I can pretend
that is a medal my Captain got in the battle when
his sword was broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can do that,&#8221; agreed Dick.</p>

<p>So the toy was mended again, and was almost as good
as before, and very glad the Captain was.</p>

<p>&#8220;For no matter what your men may say,&#8221;
he thought to himself, &#8220;a Captain without a
sword is like an elephant without a trunk&ndash;he doesn&#8217;t
look himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanking Patrick very much for what he had done in
mending the toy, Arnold went home, taking his set
of Soldiers with him. A little later his sister, Mirabell,
followed, bringing with her the Lamb on Wheels. And
when the two toys were left alone, the children having
gone to supper, they talked together&ndash;did the Soldier
and the Lamb.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certainly having plenty of adventures,&#8221;
said the Lamb, in her bleating voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And for a time, when I saw the White Rocking
Horse bearing down on me, I thought all my adventures
were over,&#8221; replied the Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that careless boy never comes around
where we are again,&#8221; said the Lamb, and the
Soldier hoped the same thing.</p>

<p>And now I must tell you another adventure that happened
to the Bold Tin Soldier. It was about a week after
the White Rocking Horse had run over him, and he was
getting used to the shiny &#8220;medal,&#8221; as
Arnold called it, that one day when the boy was having
a make-believe battle with his Tin Soldiers Mirabell
called from the kitchen:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Arnold, come on down! Susan has baked some
lovely cookies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; cried Arnold, and,
as he happened to have the Bold Tin Soldier in his
hand just then, he took the Captain along when he ran
down to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the cookies?&#8221; asked Arnold,
who was feeling hungry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here on the table,&#8221; replied Susan.
&#8220;Put your Soldier down, Arnold, and sit up and
eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, as it happened, there was an open barrel of sugar
in the kitchen. The cook had taken some sugar out
to use in making the cookies, and had forgotten to
put the cover back on. And Arnold, being in a hurry,
put his Captain down on a little shelf just over this
barrel.</p>

<p>How it happened no one seemed to know, but perhaps
in eating his cookie Arnold struck the Captain with
his elbow. Anyhow, down into the sugar barrel fell
the Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my! Now I am a bunch of sweetness!&#8221;
thought the Captain, as he felt the grains of sugar
rolling all over him. &#8220;Oh this is certainly
a strange adventure! What a sweet time I shall have!&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch9"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER IX</h1>

<h2 align="center">BACK TO THE STORE</h2>

<p>The moment he had fallen into the barrel of sugar
the Bold Tin Soldier scrambled to his feet and wiggled
around until he got his head sticking up above the
pile of sweet, white grains.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t do that, I may drown,&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;It would be strange to drown in
a barrel of sugar! I don&#8217;t want to do that!&#8221;</p>

<p>So he wiggled around until he could stand upright,
buried to his neck in the sugar, but with his head
out so he could look around with his painted tin eyes
and breathe through his tin nose. Otherwise he would
have smothered.</p>

<p>The barrel was not full of sugar. In fact, it was
only about a foot deep on the bottom, but that was
enough to more than cover the Bold Tin Soldier from
sight if it should get over his head. And, being low
down in the barrel as he was, the sides of it hid him
from the sight of Arnold and the cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are good cookies, Susan,&#8221; said
Arnold, as he ate the last crumbs of the dainty the
cook had given him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like them,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Would you care for another?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, yes,&#8221; the boy answered. And
just as Susan was giving him one, and also passing
another to Mirabell, Dick, the boy from next door,
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on out into the yard, Arnold. I have a
new little kitten!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I want to see it!&#8221; shouted Mirabell.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; added Arnold. &#8220;And please,
Susan, may I have a cookie for Dick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the good-natured cook.</p>

<p>So out to the yard rushed the children, Arnold forgetting
all about his Tin Captain. And as Susan was very busy,
she gave no thought to the Bold Tin Soldier. In fact,
if she had thought of him at all, she would have imagined
that Arnold had taken his toy with him.</p>

<p>So while the children were out playing with Dick&#8217;s
new kitten, and while the cook worked in the kitchen,
the Captain stayed in the barrel of sugar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is certainly an adventure,&#8221;
thought the Captain, &#8220;and, though it is a sweet
one, I can not say I altogether like it. I wonder
how I can get out of here? I must get back to my men,
or they will think I have deserted them. That would
never do for a soldier!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up toward the open top of the barrel. It
seemed far above his head, but he thought if he could
cut little steps in the wooden sides of the barrel
with his shiny tin sword he might be able to climb
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course I&#8217;ll have to wait until
night, when everything is still and quiet,&#8221;
thought the Captain to himself. &#8220;It would never
do for me to be seen cutting my way up out of a barrel
of sugar. That would give away the great secret of
Toy-land-that we can move of ourselves. Yes, I must
wait until after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, buried up to his neck in sugar as he was, the
Bold Tin Soldier stood in the sweetness like a sentinel
on guard. He was doing his duty in the barrel, as
he had done it when he cut down the Calico Clown and
saved that chap from burning at the gas jet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see the Clown now,&#8221;
thought the Captain. &#8220;It is lonesome here. But
if the Calico Clown saw me he would make up some joke
or riddle about me, very likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden there was a loud, banging noise
and it became very dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! what&#8217;s that?&#8221; said the Bold
Tin Soldier to himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s as dark
as night in here now, but I never knew evening to come
as suddenly as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Truly it was as dark as night in the sugar barrel
now, but it was not because night had come. It was
because the cook had put the cover on the barrel,
for she had finished her baking for the day.</p>

<p>But the Captain thought it was night, and since he
was sure no one could see him now he drew his sword
from the scabbard, or case, and started to get ready
to cut little steps in the sides of the barrel to
make a place where he might climb to the top.</p>

<p>While this was going on Arnold and Mirabell were out
looking at Dick&#8217;s pet kitten. Truly it was a
little fluffy one, and so soft that the children loved
to pet it. But after a while Arnold thought of his
Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I left the Captain on the shelf in the
kitchen,&#8221; said the little boy. &#8220;I must
go get him and put him with the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back to the kitchen he ran.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221; asked Susan, who was
getting ready to go out, for it was her afternoon
off. &#8220;Do you want more cookies, Arnold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I want my Tin Captain,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;I left him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean your Soldier,&#8221; said the
cook. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him. I don&#8217;t
believe you left him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes I did!&#8221; declared Arnold.</p>

<p>But the Bold Tin Soldier was not in sight, of course,
being down in the barrel of sugar, as we know. And
though Arnold and the cook looked for him they could
not find him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; sighed Arnold, when he could
not find the commander of his tin army, &#8220;where
is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have taken him out into the yard and
forgotten about it,&#8221; said the cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;No I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the little boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is among your other playthings,&#8221;
the cook went on. &#8220;You had better look.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Arnold looked, and his mother and Mirabell and
Dick helped him, but the Bold Tin Soldier could not
be found. He was not with the others in their box,
and, look as he did, Arnold could not find his toy
anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never get another like him,&#8221;
sighed the little boy. &#8220;He was so nice, with
his shiny medal-button!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he was such a good Captain!&#8221; added
Dick.</p>

<p>And all this while the Bold Tin Soldier was in the
dark barrel of sugar and was getting ready to climb
up and out if he could!</p>

<p>No one was in the kitchen now. The cook had gone away
and it was not yet time for supper. So, all unseen
as he was in the barrel, the Tin Soldier could do
as he pleased.</p>

<p>With his tin sword he began cutting little niches,
or steps, in the wooden sides of the barrel. But as
the wood was quite hard, and as the tin sword was
not very sharp, it was not very easy work for the
Captain.</p>

<p>As the afternoon passed, the other Soldiers in their
box on a shelf in the playroom closet began to wonder
what had become of their Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of us ought to go in search of him,&#8221;
said the Sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but we can&#8217;t go until after dark,
when no one will see us moving about,&#8221; answered
the Corporal. &#8220;That&#8217;s the worst of being
a toy&ndash;we can not do as we please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the Captain has not deserted us,&#8221;
said a private soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deserted! I should say not!&#8221; cried the
Sergeant. &#8220;Our Captain would never desert!&#8221;</p>

<p>Evening came. The cook came back and began to get
supper. And by this time the Captain, in the sugar
barrel, had cut several little niches in the sides
of the barrel. He was working away so hard that he
never heard the cook come into the kitchen and start
to get supper.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, the cook, as she went to the
pantry to get some flour, stopped near the barrel
of sugar. She heard a queer little sound coming from
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; exclaimed the cook, &#8220;a
mouse is trying to gnaw into the sugar barrel! The
idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound the cook heard was the Captain&#8217;s tin
sword as he cut steps in the side of the barrel, so
he might climb up. But this noise sounded exactly
like the gnawing of a mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away from there!&#8221; cried the cook,
and she quickly lifted the cover off the sugar barrel,
letting in a flood of light, for it was now night
and the electric lights were glowing. &#8220;Get out!&#8221;
cried the cook, thinking to scare away the mouse,
as she thought it was.</p>

<p>Now of course as soon as the sugar barrel was opened,
and the moment the cook looked in, the Captain had
to stop work. Back into its scabbard went his sword,
and he settled down among the grains of sugar again.
He was now being looked at by human eyes, and it was
against the toy rule for him to move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I do declare!&#8221; cried the cook, as
she glanced at the Bold Tin Soldier lying in the sugar.
&#8220;Here is Arnold&#8217;s Captain he has been
looking for. He is in the kitchen, after all, but how
did he get in this barrel? And where is the mouse
that was gnawing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course there was no mouse&ndash;it was the Captain&#8217;s
sword making the noise. But the cook did not know
that.</p>

<p>She leaned down and picked the Captain up in her fingers.
So he got out of the sugar barrel after all, you see,
without having to cut a ladder in the wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arnold! Arnold!&#8221; called Susan up the
back stairs. &#8220;I have found your Tin Captain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was he?&#8221; asked the little boy,
who was playing with the other soldiers, and wishing
he had their commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was in the barrel of sugar,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;You must have dropped him in when you
were eating cookies this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I did!&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;Oh,
I am so glad to get you back!&#8221; he went on, as
he carried the Captain upstairs. &#8220;Thank you,
Susan!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Bold Tin Soldier was placed at the head of
his men on the table, and they were together once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to you? Why were you away from
us so long?&#8221; whispered the Sergeant to the Captain,
when Arnold went out of the room a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in a barrel of sugar,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about it later.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that night, when all was still and quiet in the
house, the Captain told his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a wonderful adventure!&#8221; said
the Corporal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the Captain, &#8220;it was.
I wish the toys back at the store could hear it. I
rather think it would surprise the Calico Clown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold was playing with his tin toys one day when
his mother called to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arnold, get on your overcoat. I am going to
take you and Mirabell down to the toy store. I want
to get a little Easter present for your cousin Madeline.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what fun!&#8221; cried Arnold, and before
he thought what he was doing he thrust the Tin Captain
into his coat pocket and took him with him when he
went with his mother and sister to the store; that&#8217;s
what Arnold did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! what is going to happen now?&#8221;
thought the Bold Tin Soldier, as he found himself
in Arnold&#8217;s pocket on his way back to the store.</p>

<a name="ch10"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER X</h1>

<h2 align="center">THE SOLDIER AND THE RABBIT</h2>

<p>Arnold and Mirabell rode up in the store elevator
with their mother to the floor where the toys were
displayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say you wanted to get for Madeline?&#8221;
asked Mirabell, as she walked along looking at the
pretty things on the counters and shelves.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little Easter present,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;Perhaps I can find some pretty little bunny,
or a novelty of some sort, that Madeline would like.
You children may help me pick it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see if there are any more
Tin Soldiers like mine,&#8221; said Arnold.</p>

<p>The children and their mother came near the toy counter.
On it were many playthings that boys and girls like.
The Calico Clown was there, the Monkey on a Stick,
a Jumping Jack, and others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I had that Jumping Jack!&#8221;
exclaimed Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have plenty of toys,&#8221; said his
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But
I wish&ndash;I er&ndash;wish&ndash;I er&ndash;a-ker-choo!&#8221; suddenly
sneezed Arnold, and as he felt his nose tickling he
took his handkerchief from his pocket with a jerk.</p>

<p>And with the handkerchief out came the Bold Tin Soldier
which the boy had stuffed into his pocket when he
hurried downstairs as his mother called him to go
shopping with her and Mirabell.</p>

<p>Out popped the Bold Tin Soldier, and he bounced right
over on to the toy counter, just the very same place
where he had lived before he came to Arnold&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. look!&#8221; cried Mirabell. &#8220;How
funny! I didn&#8217;t know you had brought your Tin
Soldier Captain with you, Arnold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it myself! I guess I must
have stuffed him into my pocket and forgotten about
him,&#8221; the little boy said. &#8220;But I am not
going to leave him here. I like him too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it happened, the Bold Tin Soldier, when he was
pulled out with the handkerchief, landed on the toy
counter right side up, standing on his feet. And,
as it also happened, he landed near the Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, my dear, that you were
going to bring any of your toys with you,&#8221; said
Arnold&#8217;s mother, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it either!&#8221; he answered,
with a laugh. He reached out his hand to pick up his
Soldier and put him back in his pocket when, down
at the other end of the toy counter, one of the clerks
suddenly began spinning a humming top, which showed
different colors and played a little tune as it whirled
around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I want to see that!&#8221; cried Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221; echoed Mirabell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that would be an Easter toy for Madeline,&#8221;
thought Mother.</p>

<p>So all three of them moved down toward the end of
the toy counter, Arnold, for the moment, forgetting
about his Tin Captain, who was thus left standing
among his old friends with no one to watch him or
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how glad we are to see you here again!&#8221;
exclaimed the Calico Clown. &#8220;We have only a
moment before the folks come back, but tell us all
about your adventures.&#8221;</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/illus-03.png"><img src="images/illus-03.png" width="50%" border="0" alt="Bold Tin Soldier Compliments Calico Clown."></a><br>
Bold Tin Soldier Compliments Calico Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it would take too long,&#8221; said the
Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;I have had some remarkable
ones, but falling into a sugar barrel was the queerest.
But what a fine pair of trousers you have, Clown,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>The funny chap looked pleased at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, these are the new ones the girl made for
me after I scorched mine climbing the string too near
the gas&ndash;the time you saved me, you know,&#8221; replied
the Clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! you look gay enough for a circus,&#8221;
said the Soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to join one,&#8221; the Clown
went on. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t suppose there is
any chance. I&#8217;ve been on this toy counter so
long I&#8217;m beginning to believe I shall always
live here. But you&ndash;you have been out to see the world!
You have had adventures!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you may say I have,&#8221; admitted
the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;But though my men and
I have a fine home with Arnold, still I get lonesome
for you toys once in a while. I have met the Sawdust
Doll, the White Rocking Horse, and the Lamb on Wheels.
Now I am glad to meet you all once more. And how is
my friend the Candy Rabbit?&#8221; the Captain asked,
as he saw the long-eared chap standing near him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite well, thank you,&#8221; the Rabbit
answered. &#8220;It will soon be Easter, and then
perhaps my adventures will begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is good to see you again,&#8221;
said the Monkey on a Stick to the Captain. &#8220;I
have been wishing I could get away from here for a
time, to have some adventures, but, so far, I haven&#8217;t
had a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your time will come,&#8221; said the Captain.
&#8220;You are such a lively chap that I should think
you would have many things happen to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m not slow, whatever else you
may say about me,&#8221; chattered the Monkey, and,
with that, he turned a somersault on his stick, but
of course none of the people in the store saw him,
for that was not allowed, you know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! The people are coming back!&#8221; suddenly
called the Candy Rabbit, and, surely enough, Mirabell,
Arnold and their mother came back after having seen
the buzzing top.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that would not be just the right kind
of an Easter present I want for Madeline,&#8221; said
Mirabell&#8217;s mother. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look here,
among the toys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get her a Candy Rabbit?&#8221;
asked Mirabell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I will,&#8221; said Mother. She picked
the Candy Rabbit up and looked at him. He was a fine
fellow, colored just like a real rabbit, and with
pink eyes and a pink nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now my adventures will soon begin,&#8221;
thought the Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this will do very nicely for Madeline,&#8221;
said the mother of the two children. &#8220;I will
come at Easter for it,&#8221; she went on to the clerk.
&#8220;Come, children.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Arnold had picked up his Bold Tin Soldier
and put him back in his pocket, the children and their
mother left the store.</p>

<p>The Captain wished he might have had another chance
to speak to his toy friends, but it was not to be
just then.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if I shall see the Candy Rabbit again,&#8221;
he thought as he made himself comfortable in Arnold&#8217;s
warm pocket.</p>

<p>In a little while the children were back home again
after the shopping trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to play with my Lamb on Wheels,&#8221;
said Mirabell. &#8220;I am going to take her over
to Dorothy&#8217;s house to see the Sawdust Doll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll take my Soldiers over and have
some fun with Dick and his White Rocking Horse,&#8221;
said Arnold.</p>

<p>And when the four toys in Dick&#8217;s house had a
chance to talk among themselves, as the children were
out of the room for a while, the Captain said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have such news for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the Candy Rabbit is going to be sent
to a little girl named Madeline for an Easter present,&#8221;
said the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that girl-Madeline-lives right across
the street!&#8221; exclaimed the White Rocking Horse.
&#8220;She is Mirabell&#8217;s cousin, and she knows
Dorothy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then maybe we shall see the Candy Rabbit
again,&#8221; said the Bold Tin Soldier. &#8220;I
am glad of that!&#8221;</p>

<p>And as for what happened next-well, if you wish to
know you may find out by reading the next book of
this series, which will be called &#8220;The Story
of a Candy Rabbit.&#8221; In it you will again meet
the Bold Tin Soldier and all his friends.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
